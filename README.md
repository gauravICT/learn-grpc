On the path of learning gRPC.

Part-1 - Implementing Unary Greet API Using gRPC

Part-2 - Implementation of  a Sum RPC Unary API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has two integers, and returns a Response that represents the sum of them.

Example:

The client will send two numbers (8 and 22) and the server will respond with (30)

Part-3 - Implementing Server Streaming

Part-4 - Implementation of a  PrimeNumberDecomposition RPC Server Streaming API in a CalculatorService:

The function takes a Request message that has one integer, and returns a stream of Responses that represent the prime number decomposition of that number.

Example:

The client will send one number (120) and the server will respond with a stream of (2,2,2,3,5), because 120=2*2*2*3*5
